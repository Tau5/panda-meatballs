# Panda meatballs

This mod adds panda meat and panda meatballs to the game, this way, panda can be useful to the minecraft society and economy and make it's citizens lives better (because now, pandas will be eatable)

Be aware that eating raw panda meat is not advised, as it will make you go through a mental introspection of your values and morals for a few seconds, making you vulnerable to attacks. In the aftermath of your introspection, you will feel miserable and have bad luck until you soothe your worries drinking ~~alcohol~~ milk.

(I think) This mod requires Fabric API

A lot of (virtual) pandas have been hurt in the development of this mod
